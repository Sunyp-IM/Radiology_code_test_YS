Lungs:  There is increased patchy opacity in the right midlung zone. Again seen are patchy airspace opacities in the lower lung zones. Upper lobes are hyperinflated bilaterally.   Pleura:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Lenticular opacity in the right midlung zone likely reflects layering pleural effusion, better seen on prior chest CT.   Heart and mediastinum:  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal. Aortic arch calcifications.   Bones:  Thoracic skeleton is unchanged.   IMPRESSION:  Increased patchy opacities in the right mid lung zone, may represent aspiration/pneumonia, or asymmetric pulmonary edema superimposed upon pre-existing upper lobe emphysema.   Airspace opacities of the lung bases are unchanged and likely due to bronchiectasis. However, superimposed pneumonia could also be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.   "

The previously demonstrated nodular opacity in the right lower hemithorax is not as well demonstrated currently, secondary to the superimposed patchy opacity as described above.               "

COMPARISON: Portable XR CHEST PORTABLE [REDACTED] , XR CHEST PA AND LATERAL 2  VIEWS [REDACTED] and multiple prior studies dating back to 2 View Chest [REDACTED] .   FINDINGS:  Lines/tubes:  None.   Lungs:  On the PA and lateral views, there is a new region of airspace opacity in the posterior aspect of the right lower lobe. This is seen best on the lateral projection overlying the posterior aspect of the diaphragms. Opacity may also be present in the left retrocardiac region. These findings are new compared to [REDACTED] . Lung volumes are low.   Pleura:  Opacity overlying the right hemidiaphragm is demonstrated. There is blunting of the posterior costophrenic sulci and lateral view.   Heart and mediastinum:  Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is more prominent than on prior examinations. The current examination is obtained to more lordotic patient positioning. The current appearance is similar however compared to [REDACTED] suggesting this may in part be related to AP lordotic technique.   Bones:  There are degenerative changes seen in the thoracic spine. There is a fixation screw in the region of left scapula.   IMPRESSION:   New airspace opacities in the medial lower lobes seen best on the lateral view.
